# gpt-experiment
This repository contains my experiment with GPTxyzü§ñ.

## chatapp.py
This file contains an application with ChatGPT(GPT-3.5-turbo) API. It allows you to experiment the full potential of ChatGPT.

To get started you have to install 2 librairies:

## 1. openai üï∏
This allows you access access the gpt models and others usefull fonctionalities.
To do so: 
### $pip install openai

After installing openai, you will need to include your openai api key in the code. Check your openai profile to find out.

## 2. gradio ‚ö°
This is an api that will provide you a UI to interact with your application.
To install it:
### $pip install gradio

Once done with the set up, go on and write your code. You can twick as you want.
For trial, you can access the app through your terminal, in a web browser and you can even share the public link to anyone you want.
